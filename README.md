The goal of this program is to build face detection software that can identify human faces from a video.

The program is written in Python.

Requirements:
- Python 3.6
- OpenCV 3.4.1
- Mediapipe 0.8.1

You can install the requirements by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the program, run the following command:
```bash
python faceDetectionModule.py
```

The program will open a window and start detecting faces from the video.
Note: You have to specify the video path in the code. It is located under the "cap" variable.
